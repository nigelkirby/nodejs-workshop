# NodeJS Workshop

## Prerequisites
The following tools are needed for the workshop:

### git - [install instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
I suggest using xcode's version for mac and https://git-scm.com/download/win for windows. Windows users please install git-bash as well.
### text editor - [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
If you have a preferred text editor feel free to use it but vscode has a lot of well supported plugins for a variety of languages and is my preference for NodeJS development.
